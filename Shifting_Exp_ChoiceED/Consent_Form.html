{{ block content }}

<p>
    You are being asked to participate or be part of a research study. Your participation is
    <b>voluntary</b> which means that you may choose not to participate at any time.
</p>

<p>The researchers in this experiment hope to learn more about how individuals make economic decisions.
    You are being asked to participate because we used Prolific's database to recruit subjects for the experiment.
    You will be asked to make various choice decisions in this experiment.
</p>

<p>
    We anticipate that this experiment will take around {{ C.ETA }} minutes, so please be ready to pay attention for
    at least that period of time.
</p>

<p>
    <b>
        Please take time to review the rest of the information. This will give you information about this study to help
        you decide if you want to participate.
    </b>
</p>

<p>
    <b><u>
    This study is only intended for people who are 18 years of age or older.  Do not complete the study if you are not legally considered an adult.
    </u></b>

</p>

<p>
    <b><u>
    Before agreeing to participate, consider the risks and potential benefits of taking part in this study.
    </u></b>
</p>

<p>
    All research carries the risk of breach of confidentiality which means that someone outside of our
    study could figure out that you were in the study or information was yours.  How we will protect your
    information to reduce this risk is below.

    </br></br>

    Some questions could make you feel uncomfortable. You can stop answering if you would like.

    </br></br>

    It is unlikely that there will be personal benefits to you for participating (outside of payment). Having more information
    from the answers in this research study might help us or other researchers understand more about economic decision making.

</p>

<p>
    <b><u>Will I receive payment or other incentives?</u></b> </br>
    You will receive {{C.COMPLETION_FEE}} dollars for completing the experiment. You will also have the opportunity to make more money
    based on the decisions that you make in the experiment.
</p>

<p>
    <b><u>How will the researchers protect my information, privacy, and confidentiality?</u></b></br>
    Your personal information may be shared outside the research study if required by law. We also may need to share
    your research records with other groups for quality assurance or data analysis. These groups include the Purdue
    University Institutional Review Board or its designees, and state or federal agencies who may need to access the
    research records (as allowed by law).</br></br>

    Your research information may also be shared with collaborators on this research at the University of Innsbruck and
    Whitman College. </br></br>

    The study team plans to keep answers for this study to answer research questions.  We will keep this information
    until we are done with the study, approximately three years and for at least three years after we are finished.
    We may share the anonymous data and findings with other researchers or in research papers or presentations.
