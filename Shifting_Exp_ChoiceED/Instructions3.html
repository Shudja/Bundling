    In each Situation, you will make decisions involving two sets of four urns. Each urn has
    {{ C.NUM_BALLS }} balls inside of them (which can either be green or purple). Each urn comes with a description of
    how it was created (i.e., an Urn Creation Rule). For example, the first urn in the first set might have a 50%
    chance of having 72 green balls and 28 purple balls and a 50% chance of having 33 green balls and 67 purple balls.
    The other urns are similar to this urn but have their own creation rules. For example, the second urn in
    the first set might have a 50% chance of having 50 green balls and 50 purple balls and a 50% chance of having 39
    green balls and 61 purple balls. The fourth urn in the second set might have a 100% chance of having 80 green
    balls and 20 purple balls.

<p>
    In each Situation, you will be presented with two sets of four urns. The urns used in a Situation
    were created independently from urns in other Situations. That means the creation of an urn is unaffected by
    the creation of any other urn. If the Urn Creation Rule is the same in two different Situations, the urns themselves
    are new in the sense that a separate instance of the Urn Creation Rule generated the urn in each Situation.
    In each of these Situations, you will make two choices in each set. Whenever you choose an urn, you
    will draw a ball from that urn. Whenever you draw from an
    urn and the drawn ball is a green ball, you will receive {{ C.BET_PAY }} points.
    Whenever you draw from an urn and the drawn ball is a purple ball, you will receive 0 points.
</p>

<p>
    In each Situation, you will first decide which urn to draw from in each set. You will then be shown the color of the ball
    drawn from each chosen urn and you will be paid for any green balls that you draw. These balls will then
    be placed back into their appropriate urns and you will once again decide which urn to draw from in each set.
    You will then be shown the color of the ball drawn from each chosen urn and
    you will be paid for any green balls that you draw. You can choose the same urn in a set for both choices, or different
    urns, it is up to you.
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned above, the urns presented to you in a Situation are new urns that are
    separate from the urns in the other Situations. These urns do not change
    within a Situation. That is, these urns were created at the start of the experiment according to their Urn Creation
    Rule and any ball drawn is placed back inside the appropriate urn before the next decision. Once again, we do not
    observe the composition of any of these urns until the end of the experiment.
