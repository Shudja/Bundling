<p>
    In each Situation, you will make decisions involving four options. Each option contains one urn, which each has
    {{ C.NUM_BALLS }} balls inside of them (which can either be green or purple). Each urn comes with a description of
    how it was created (i.e., an Urn Creation Rule). For example, the urn in the first option might have a 50% chance of having 72 green balls and 28 purple
    balls and a 50% chance of having 33 green balls and 67 purple balls. The other urns are similar to this urn but have
    their own creation rules. For example, the urn in the third option might have a 50% chance of having 50 green balls
    and 50 purple balls and a 50% chance of having 39 green balls and 61 purple balls. The urn in the fourth option
    might have a 100% chance of having 80 green balls and 20 purple balls.

<p>
    In each Situation, you will be presented with four options that each have one urn. The urns used in a Situation were
    created independently from urns in other Situations. That means the creation of an urn is unaffected by
    the creation of any other urn. If the Urn Creation Rule is the same in two different Situations, the urns themselves
    are new in the sense that a separate instance of the Urn Creation Rule generated the urn in each Situation.
    In each of these Situations, you will make two choices between the four options. Whenever you choose an option,
    you will draw a ball from the urn in the option. Whenever you draw from an urn and the drawn ball is a green ball,
    you will receive {{ C.BET_PAY }} points. Whenever you draw from an urn and the drawn ball is a purple ball, you will
    receive 0 points.
</p>

<p>
    In each Situation, you will first decide which option to implement. You will then be shown the color of the ball drawn
    from the urn in the option and you will be paid for it if it is a green ball. This ball will then be placed back into
    the appropriate urn and you will make a second decision between the four options. You will once again decide which
    of the four options to choose. You will then be shown the color of the ball drawn from the urn in the option and you will be paid
    for it if it is a green ball. You can choose the same option for both choices, or different options, it is up to you.
</p>

<p>
    As mentioned above, the urns presented to you in a Situation are new urns that are
    separate from the urns in the other Situations. These urns do not change
    within a Situation. That is, these urns were created at the start of the experiment according to their Urn Creation
    Rule and the first ball drawn is placed back inside the urn before the next decision. Once again, we do not
    observe the composition of any of these urns until the end of the experiment.
