    will be implemented fully and truthfully.

<p>
    In this experiment, you will earn 'points'.  These points will be converted into Dollars at the end of the
    experiment at the rate of 1 point = {{ C.EXCHANGE_RATE }} Dollars. In this experiment, you will be taking part in
    ten Situations. We will pay you your earnings from one randomly selected Situation out of the ten Situations you
    complete today. This "paying'' Situation was already selected as it was randomly selected by the computer when
    you first opened the experiment.  Each Situation was equally likely to be selected.
</p>

<p>
    In this experiment, you will face Situations that involve drawing balls
    from computerized urns. <b>All of the urns used in this experiment were already created as they were created
    when you first opened the experiment and we have not seen the
    composition of any of these urns.</b>
