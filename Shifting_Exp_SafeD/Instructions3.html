<p>
    In each Situation, you will make decisions involving urns. Each urn has
    {{ C.NUM_BALLS }} balls inside of them (which can either be green or purple). Each urn comes with a description of
    how it was created (i.e., an Urn Creation Rule). For example, one urn might have a 50% chance
    of having 72 green balls and 28 purple balls and a 50% chance of having 33 green balls and 67 purple balls.
    The other urns are similar to this urn but have their own creation rules. For example, another urn might have a
    50% chance of having 50 green balls and 50 purple balls and a 50% chance of having 39 green balls and 61 purple
    balls. Another urn might have a 100% chance of having 80 green balls and 20 purple balls.
</p>

<p>
    <b>The urns used in a Situation were
    created independently from urns in other Situations (and all other urns in the experiment).</b> That means the creation of an urn is unaffected by
    the creation of any other urn. If the Urn Creation Rule is the same in two different Situations, the urns themselves
    are new in the sense that a separate instance of the Urn Creation Rule generated the urn in each Situation.
