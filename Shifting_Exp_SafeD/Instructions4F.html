<p>
    In each Situation, you will be presented with four options that each have two urns. Each urn in a Situation is a separate urn.
    In each of these Situations,
    you will make two choices between the four options. Whenever you choose an option, you
    will draw a ball from each of the two urns in the option. <b>Whenever you draw from an
    urn and the drawn ball is a green ball, you will receive {{ C.BET_PAY }} points.</b>
    Whenever you draw from an urn and the drawn ball is a purple ball, you will receive 0 points.
</p>

<p>
    In each Situation, you will first decide between the four options. You will then <b>be shown the color of the ball
    drawn from each urn in the option you chose</b> and you will receive points for any green balls that you draw. These balls will then be placed back into
    their corresponding urns and <b>you will make a second decision between the four options</b>. You will once again decide
    which of the four options to choose. You will then be shown the color of the ball drawn from each urn in the option
    you chose and
    you will receive points for any green balls that you draw. You can choose the same option for both choices, or different
    options, it is up to you.
</p>


<p>
    As mentioned previously, the urns presented to you in a Situation are new urns that are
    separate from the urns in the other Situations. <b>These urns do not change
    within a Situation.</b> That is, these urns were created at the start of the experiment according to their Urn Creation
    Rule and any ball drawn is placed back inside the corresponding urn before the next decision. Once again, we do not
    observe the composition of any of these urns until the end of the experiment.
</p>


<p>On the next page, we will go through an example Situation.</p>
